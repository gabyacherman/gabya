  I was born in Caracas, Venezuela and moved to the U.S in 2009. I first went to study at Florida International University
  <br> in
  2017 majoring in Architecture. However, in the fall of 2019 I decided to change majors and university.
  Finally I decided
  <br> that moving to the University of Miami with the major Interactive Media, would be the best
 fit for me. I believe my <br>experiences in the past will help me confident and strong in the future.
